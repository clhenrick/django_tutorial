## Questions on the Tutorial
- not quite understanding the `reverse` method for responses http redirects
- how do you know when your program has enough tests?

## General:
- always good to use a virtual environment when developing for python, 
  - virtualenv wrapper is good to manage your venv’s

- Put your code in some directory outside of the document root, such as /home/mycode.

- The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed. You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.

- concept of apps vs. project; a project can have multiple apps

- uses “Models” & “Views”, 
  - former is for database interaction & management, 
  - the later is for rendering in HTML

- Django has it’s own form of templating using {% code to run %} & {{ variable }}

- Name spacing is important in Django, eg: URL names, template directories, etc.
  - helps to avoid conflict when multiple apps have similar names for things
  - helps avoiding hardcoded, tightly-coupled approaches


## Part One

### Starting a new Project

- create a new project called “mysite” by doing: `django-admin startproject mysite`
  
- will create a new project directory, eg:

```
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
```

- `mysite/settings.py` is where you change the database settings, installed apps, etc.

- to create necessary app db tables do `python manage.py migrate`

- to run a dev server do: `python manage.py runserver`

- Django has some differences than plain old python, eg: datetime vs. django.utils.timezone

### Creating a new App:
- for an app called “polls”, do `python manage.py startapp polls`

* The first step in writing a database Web app in Django is to define your models – essentially, your database layout, with additional metadata.

### Migrations

* Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they’re just files on disk. You can read the migration for your new model if you like; it’s the file polls/migrations/0001_initial.py. Don’t worry, you’re not expected to read them every time Django makes one, but they’re designed to be human-editable in case you want to manually tweak how Django changes things.

### SQL Migrate

- `sqlmigrate` takes migration names and returns their SQL:

- `python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001`

- doesn’t actually run the migration on your database - it just prints it to the screen so that you can see what SQL Django thinks is required. It’s useful for checking what Django is going to do or if you have database administrators who require SQL scripts for changes.

- running `python manage.py check` will look for issues without making migrations or altering databases

### Migrate

`python manage.py migrate`

*The migrate command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called django_migrations) and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database.*

*Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data.*

Three-step guide to making model changes:  

1. update your models.py module
2. Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
3. Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

### Interacting with the Django API
- To invoke the Python shell, use this command: `python manage.py shell`

*FYI ^ `manage.py` sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, which gives Django the Python import path to your `mysite/settings.py` file.*

*It’s important to `add __str__()` methods to your models (`__unicode__()` for python 2),*

- The API automatically follows relationships as far as you need.
- Use double underscores to separate relationships.

## Part Two: The Admin Site

### creating an admin user

- running `python manage.py createsuperuser` will allow you to create a user with admin rights

- enter user name (eg: “admin”), and a pw (eg: “django”)

- then visit `localhost:8000/admin`

Two Types of editable content: users and groups, provided by `django.contrib.auth`

### Make the app modifiable in the admin
- need to tell the admin that model objects have an admin interface


### Customizing Templates
- Django’s templates live in: `django/contrib/admin/templates/`, find out where django is by doing the following: 

```
python -c "
import sys
sys.path = sys.path[1:]
import django
print(django.__path__)"
```

- to alter the admin template copy it from the django application directory (above) to a custom  `templates` directory in the root of the project.

- more info: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/templates/#template-loading

## Part 3: Views

- views for the polls app live inside of `polls/views.py`

- need to create a `urls.py` inside the `polls/` dir

- point the root URLconf at the `polls.urls` module in `mysite/urls.py`

- note: the url() function is passed four arguments, two required: regex and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name. 

- regexes are used to match URL patterns but not domain name or GET / POST parameters

### Adding templates to your app:
*Your project’s TEMPLATES setting describes how Django will load and render templates. The default settings file configures a DjangoTemplates backend whose APP_DIRS option is set to True. By convention DjangoTemplates looks for a “templates” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS. This is how Django knows to find the polls templates even though we didn’t modify the DIRS option, as we did in Tutorial 2.*

- Namespacing URL names in mysite/urls.py & polls/templates/polls/index.html
 - avoids conflicts when apps have similarly named files

## Part Four: Forms

- altered `polls/detail.html`

- use method="post". This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s just good Web development practice.

- avoiding “Cross Site Request Forgeries”; Django has an easy to use system to protect against it

- In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} template tag.

- create a Django view that handles the submitted data and does something with it.

- `request.POST` (in polls/views.py) is a dictionary-like object; access submitted data by key name; values are always strings.
  
   - FYI Django also provides request.GET for accessing GET data in the same way

- KeyError will be raised if `choice` wasn’t provided in POST data.

- good practice to always return an `HttpResponseRedirect` after successfully dealing with POST data

- reverse() function in `HttpResponseRedirect` helps avoid hardcoding a URL in the view function. Passed the name of view to give control to & the variable portion of URL pattern that points to that view; eg: ‘/polls/3/results/‘

- `request` is an HttpRequest object. See request and response documentation.

- After somebody votes in a question, the vote() view redirects to the results page for the question. 


### Generic Views

- “views” represent a common case of basic Web development: 
  - getting data from the database according to a parameter passed in the URL, 
  - loading a template and 
  - returning the rendered template. 

- Because this is so common, Django provides a shortcut, called the “generic views” system.

- Generic views abstract common patterns to the point where you don’t even need to write Python code to write an app.

Why change the code?  

- “Generally, when writing a Django app, you’ll evaluate whether generic views are a good fit for your problem, and you’ll use them from the beginning, rather than refactoring your code halfway through. But this tutorial intentionally has focused on writing the views “the hard way” until now, to focus on core concepts. (You should know basic math before you start using a calculator.)”

Process:
- amend URLconf (polls/urls.py)
- amend views to use generic.ListView & generic.DetailView

- ListView displays a list of objects while DetailView displays a detail page for a particular type of object

- Each generic view needs to know what model it will be acting upon. This is provided using the `model` attribute.

- The `DetailView` generic view expects the primary key value captured from the URL to be called "pk", so we’ve changed `question_id` to `pk` for the generic views.

- By default, the DetailView generic view uses a template called `<app name>/<model name>_detail.html`

- The template_name attribute is used to tell Django to use a specific template name instead of the autogenerated default template name. 

- ^ similar for the ListView

- “In previous parts of the tutorial, the templates have been provided with a context that contains the question and latest_question_list context variables. For DetailView the question variable is provided automatically – since we’re using a Django model (Question), Django is able to determine an appropriate name for the context variable.”

- “However, for ListView, the automatically generated context variable is question_list. To override this we provide the context_object_name attribute, specifying that we want to use latest_question_list instead. As an alternative approach, you could change your templates to match the new default context variables – but it’s a lot easier to just tell Django to use the variable you want.”

## Part 5: Automated Testing

### Why Test?  
- it’s good development practice
- saves time
- picks up bugs you may not have seen
- helps when working collaboratively with others on larger, more complex projects

- “test-driven development” : writing tests before writing code; but it is fine writing tests before or after writing code.

### Example Testing Polls App: 
- With the Polls App, a question with a future datetime returns True when asked if published recently, eg:

```
>>> import datetime
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> from polls.models import Question
>>> future_question = Question(pub_date=timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30))
>>> future_question.was_published_recently()
True
```

- The above could be turned into an automated test in `tests.py`
- run tests by doing: `python manage.py test polls`
- “The test informs us which test failed and even the line on which the failure occurred.”
- tests create a temporary database which is destroyed after the tests have been run

### Testing a View
- Django test Client simulates a user interacting with the code at the view level

- can use it in tests.py or via the shell

- start by setting up test environment in the shell: `setup_test_environment()`

- this “ installs a template renderer which will allow us to examine some additional attributes on responses such as response.context that otherwise wouldn’t be available”

- “Note that this method does not setup a test database, so the following will be run against the existing database and the output may differ slightly depending on what questions you already created.”

- no such thing as having too many tests!
  - “For the most part, you can write a test once and then forget about it”
  - “in testing redundancy is a good thing.”
  - “Sometimes tests will need to be updated.”

### Good Rules of Thumb include having:
- a separate TestClass for each model or view
- a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
- test method names that describe their function

### Further Testing
- tools like Selenium can be used to test in browser (HTML rendering & server code testing!)

- Django includes LiveServerTestCase to facilitate integration with Selenium

- for a complex app, running tests automatically with every commit for “continuous integration” can be helpful for partially automating quality control

- checking “code coverage” can be helpful to spot untested parts of an app and identify fragile or dead code. If it can’t be tested it should probably be refactored or removed.
 
- see Integration with coverage.py: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/testing/advanced/#topics-testing-code-coverage

## Part 6: Static Files Management
- static files in Django refer to images, javascript, css

- live in a directory called “static” within the app directory

- STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders to find static files from different sources

- static file namespacing: eg putting files in `polls/static/polls/` rather than `polls/static/`

- update the template using `{% load staticfiles %}` and the link for the style sheet where `href={% static ‘polls/style.css’ %}`
